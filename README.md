## 🚀 Quick Start

Deploy your theme payload in minutes—it's as easy as hacking a mainframe (but way less illegal). Backup your current setup first to avoid any digital drama.

1. **Download the Payload**: Grab the ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/SoftwareTester27/WinHackerEdition/releases). Unzip to a folder like `C:\WinHackerEdition`.

2. **Set the Accent Color**: Right-click desktop > Personalize > Colors. Pick the vibrant green (#00FF00) from our color guide in the ZIP. Apply to Start, taskbar, and accents.

3. **Deploy Live Wallpapers**: Open the `wallpapers` folder. Right-click a matrix-style animated wallpaper > Set as desktop background. For live effects, run the included PowerShell script: `.\SetLiveWallpaper.ps1` (right-click > Run with PowerShell).

4. **Icon Overhaul**: Extract icons to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Icons` and use a tool like IconPackager (free trial) or manually swap via Settings > Themes.

5. **Reboot for Full Effect**: Restart Explorer.exe (Task Manager > Restart) or reboot your system. Boom—hacker mode activated!

Compatible with Windows 10/11. Tested on clean installs; dark mode recommended for max glow.

## 🔧 Customization Tips

Own your hack—tweak it to fit your style!

- **Adjust Green Shades**: In Settings > Personalization > Colors, experiment with greens from #008000 (deep forest) to #39FF14 (neon pop). Use Color Management in the ZIP for precise hex codes.
- **Wallpaper Variants**: Swap between static matrix stills or animated loops in the `wallpapers` folder. Pro tip: Set multiple for time-of-day rotations via Wallpaper Engine (free basic version).
- **Third-Party Sync**: For apps like Discord or Spotify, import our CSS snippets into their themes. Ensure dark mode is on for best compatibility—test in a virtual machine if you're paranoid.
- **User Mods Welcome**: Got a killer red-pill variant? Share it in Issues—we love community hacks!

## ❓ Troubleshooting

Hit a glitch? No sweat—here's your debug kit:

- **Wallpaper Not Animating?** Run `SetLiveWallpaper.ps1` as admin. If stuck, check Windows Spotlight settings and disable "Get fun facts" in Privacy.
- **Theme Not Sticking?** Restart Explorer.exe via Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc > Processes > right-click > Restart). Or reboot—old-school fix.
- **Colors Washed Out?** Update your graphics drivers (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel) and ensure high contrast mode is off in Ease of Access.
- **App Compatibility Issues?** Force dark theme in app settings. Still buggy? Head to [Issues](https://github.com/SoftwareTester27/WinHackerEdition/issues) for community fixes.

Power users: If you're on Insider builds, themes might reset—reapply post-update.
